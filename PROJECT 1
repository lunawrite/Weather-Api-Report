# Weather Report Using OpenWeather API

## Introduction
Weather data is crucial for various applications, from daily forecasts to advance analytics. In this project, I used **Postman** to send requests to the **OpenWeather API** to retrieve real-time weather data for different locations. The data includes temperature, humadity, wind speed, and general weather conditions, which are formatted in JSON.

This report demonstrates how to fetch and interpret weather data using API requests. Below is an example of weather data for Jakarta.

## Data Retrieval Method
To retrieve weather data from OpenWeather API using **Postman**, follow these steps:
1. Open **Postman** and create a new request
2. Set **the request type** to **GET**
3. Enter the following URL in the request field:
   https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Jakarta&appid=YOUR_API_KEY
5. Click **Send** to fetch the weather data
6. The **API** will return a JSON response containing weather details for Jakarta.
